Small script to find the fastest NordVPN servers, filtering by location and
current capacity (i.e. server load).

Super useful if you use a third-party VPN client (like Viscosity) and want to
quickly find out the fastest server to connect to.

The script calls an undocumented NordVPN API endpoint for quick and reliable
results.

USAGE

nordvpn-server-find -r|(-l LOCATION [-c CAPACITY=30] [-n LIMIT=20] [-q])

-r   recommended  Just output the recommended server for your location and exit,
                  ignoring other options 
-q   quiet        Just output the best result for the given location, ignoring
                  the -n and the -c option 
-l   location     2-letter ISO 3166-1 country code (ex: us, uk, de) 
-c   capacity     Current server load, integer between 1-100 (defaults to 30)
-n   limit        Limits number of results, integer between 1-100 (defaults to
                  20)

The -r and -q flags can be useful for scripting. For example, on macOS this
script gets Viscosity to automatically connect to the recommended server for
your location:

    #!/usr/bin/osascript
    tell application "Viscosity"
      connect "$(nordvpn-server-find -r).tcp"
    end tell

If -q is given, manually set capacity and limit are ignored. If -r is given all
other options are ignored.
